DEPENDENCIES
============
Before installing, you must download and install the CCfits library.
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/


INSTALLATION
============

If all goes well, dendro will install by running
./configure
make

Which will create an executable "dendro" in the src/ directory. You
can install dendro system wide via

make install

though you may need root permission to do so.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

The difficulty you are most likely to run into is trying to link to
the CCfits library. If CCFits is included in some standard location
(like /usr/local), you should be fine. Otherwise, you will need to
tell the configure script where to find it.

For example, on one machine I have the CCfits headers in a file
/home/cbeaumont/include/CCfits, and the shared libraries in
/home/cbeaumon/lib/. I call configure with the following options:

./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/home/cbeaumon/include/CCfits" LDFLAGS="-L /home/cbeaumon/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/home/cbeaumon/lib"

The CPPFLAGS argument tells the comiler which directory to look in for
header files. The first LDFLAG argument (-L) tells the linker where to
look for the shared library file. The second argument (-Wl to the end)
tells the linker to hard-code this path into the executable, so
everyone knows where to find it.
